ADM is a plugin to dynamically manage a complex array of xxx.js and xxx.css dependencies. 
It will assist you in defining those dependencies and outputting the appropriate javascript_include
and stylesheet_link tags in your final layout.

I found this mostly useful when dealing with JQuery and JQuery UI's complex arrangement of js and css theme files. 
An alternative is to collect all assets into one file and depend on caching ... at least in the case of Jquery UI
though that would be 350k of scripts you might or might not use.

assumptions:
you prefer to keep your js plugins as seperate files
your js and css files all have corresponding ".xxx" extensions


Example
=======

In your Application Helper ...

Here you define a method declaring your asset dependencies. This method, which should return a Hash, 
matches symbols to values, which can be of type String, Hash, Array or Symbol. Thus you create a 
dictionary of symbols representing files you will conditionally include later on in the views for 
which they are needed.

    module ApplicationHelper
      
      def asset_dependencies
        {
          :one_script =>  'one_script.js',  
          :tabs =>        ['tabs/tabs.js', 'tabs/tabs.css'],
          :slider =>      { :js => ['slider/slider_one.js', 'slider/slider_two.js'], :css => 'slider/slider.css' },
          :testing =>     'whatever.js',
          :whatever =>    :one_script
        }
      end
      
    end

In your Views / Partials ...

You'll now a view helper called assets_for to declare which assets need to be loaded to support 
the current view or partial.

    <% assets_for :tabs, :slider, :whatever %>
    <!-- more html etc ... -->

In your Layout file ...

    <%= asset_manager_tags %>

And that will return ...

<script src="/javascripts/tabs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/javascripts/slider/slider_one.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/javascripts/slider/slider_two.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/javascripts/one_script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link href="/stylesheets/tabs.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<link href="/stylesheets/slider/slider.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
